#### The creation code
``` sql
 CREATE TABLE Pieces (
   Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   Name TEXT NOT NULL
 );
 
 CREATE TABLE Providers (
  Code TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  Name TEXT NOT NULL
 );
 
 CREATE TABLE Provides (
   Piece INTEGER  
     CONSTRAINT fk_Pieces_Code REFERENCES Pieces(Code),
   Provider TEXT
     CONSTRAINT fk_Providers_Code REFERENCES Providers(Code),
   Price INTEGER NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY(Piece, Provider)
 );
```
#### Sample datase
``` sql
 INSERT INTO Providers(Code, Name) VALUES('HAL','Clarke Enterprises');
 INSERT INTO Providers(Code, Name) VALUES('RBT','Susan Calvin Corp.');
 INSERT INTO Providers(Code, Name) VALUES('TNBC','Skellington Supplies');
 
 INSERT INTO Pieces(Code, Name) VALUES(1,'Sprocket');
 INSERT INTO Pieces(Code, Name) VALUES(2,'Screw');
 INSERT INTO Pieces(Code, Name) VALUES(3,'Nut');
 INSERT INTO Pieces(Code, Name) VALUES(4,'Bolt');
 
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(1,'HAL',10);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(1,'RBT',15);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(2,'HAL',20);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(2,'RBT',15);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(2,'TNBC',14);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(3,'RBT',50);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(3,'TNBC',45);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(4,'HAL',5);
 INSERT INTO Provides(Piece, Provider, Price) VALUES(4,'RBT',7);
```
#### Exercises
1. Select the name of all the pieces.
2. Select all the providers' data.
3. Obtain the average price of each piece (show only the piece code and the average price).
4. Obtain the names of all providers who supply piece 1.
5. Select the name of pieces provided by provider with code "HAL"
6. For each piece, find the most expensive offering of that piece and include the piece name, provider name, and price (note that there could be two providers who supply the same piece at the most expensive price).
7. Add an entry to the database to indicate that "Skellington Supplies" (code "TNBC") will provide sprockets (code "1") for 7 cents each.
8. Increase all prices by one cent.
9. Update the database to reflect that "Susan Calvin Corp." (code "RBT") will not supply bolts (code 4).
10. Update the database to reflect that "Susan Calvin Corp." (code "RBT") will not supply any pieces (the provider should still remain in the database).

``` sql
1. SELECT name FROM pieces;

2. SELECT * FROM provides;

3. SELECT	pie.name, avg(pr.price) AS avg_price FROM pieces AS pie JOIN provides AS pr ON pie.code = pr.piece GROUP BY pie.name;

4. SELECT Providers.Name FROM Providers INNER JOIN Provides ON Providers.Code = Provides.Provider AND Provides.Piece = 1;

5. SELECT Pieces.Name FROM Pieces INNER JOIN Provides ON Pieces.Code = Provides.Piece AND Provides.Provider = 'HAL';
     
6. SELECT Pieces.Name, Providers.Name, Price FROM Pieces INNER JOIN Provides ON Pieces.Code = Piece INNER JOIN Providers ON Providers.Code = Provider WHERE Price = (SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Provides WHERE Piece = Pieces.Code);
 
 7. INSERT INTO Provides VALUES (1, 'TNBC', 7);
  
 8. UPDATE Provides SET Price = Price + 1;
 
 9. DELETE FROM Provides WHERE Provider = 'RBT' AND Piece = 4;
    
10. DELETE FROM Provides WHERE Provider = 'RBT';
```
